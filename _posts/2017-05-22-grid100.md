Simulated random variables with spatial autocorrelation, on 10x10 grid.

* Observations = 100
* Variables = 34

**Source**
 The grid was created in GeoDa. The variables were simulated using R and its spdep package.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|	POLYID	|	Grid cell identifier	|
|	Z	|	Random variables for standard normal distribution	|
|	ZMAxx	|	Standard normal variates transformed to follow a spatial moving average with parameter xx (xx is 02, 05, 07, 09 for 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9)	|
|	RANZMAxx	|	Randomly permuted observations matching the variable ZMAxx	|
|	ZMANxx	|	Standard normal variates transformed to follow a spatial moving average with negative parameter xx (xx defined above)}	|
|	RANZMANxx	|	Randomly permuted counterpart of ZMANxx (xx defined above)}	|
|	ZARrxx	|	Standard normal variates transformed to follow a spatial autoregressive process with parameter xx (xx defined above)}	|
|	RANZARxx	|	Randomly permuted counterpart of ZARxx (xx defined above)}	|
|	ZARNxx	|	Standard normal variates transformed to follow a spatial autoregressive process with negative parameter xx (xx defined above)}	|
|	RANZARNxx	|	Randomly permuted counterpart of ZARNxx (xx defined above)}	|
