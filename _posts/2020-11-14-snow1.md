This dataset contains 1,852 points that represent houses in the Soho neighborhood as featured in the [1855 map by the General Board of Health](http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/21/120/15-78-1DF-22-1855-GBoH-BrSt-Map.pdf). For each house, the variables include an ID, the number of cholera deaths by residents and non-residents of the building (including non-deaths), a total death count for both types of residents, and a dummy variable that indicates whether the house was located on top of Craven Estate, a 17th-century pest-field. They also include three variables that measure distances to the pest-field, the nearest open sewer grate or ventilator, and the Broad Street pump.
