[DOWNLOAD DATA](../data/snow4.zip)

This dataset combines two other datasets: Cholera deaths by building (see [deaths](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/snow2/)) and the Broad Street pump, extracted from the 8 pumps dataset (see [pumps](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/snow6/)). 60 polygons were created that represent rings that start at the location of the Broad Street pump and progress in 5-meter increments around the pump. These rings were created in QGIS to compare them in terms of cholera deaths, thus the dataset contains the count of deaths per ring. Since the outer rings cover more area than then inner rings, we also included the ring area (in squared meters). This was used to create a variable for death density, i.e. deaths per square meter.
