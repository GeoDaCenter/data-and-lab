This dataset presents the CHilean Internal Migration database which provides a temporally consistent framework for the analysis of internal migration over a period covering twenty-five years from 1977 to 2002. Specifically, it offers a hierarchical system of 304 municipalities, 51 provinces and 13 regions, and 10 occupational groups and 11 industrial sectors which are temporally consistent over the 1977-82, 1987-92 and 1997-2002 census intervals.

(*) The Regional variables data files provides information on 10 variables for three five-year census intervals: 1977-82, 1987-92 and 1997-2002		

Note: No information for wages and exports is available for the 1977-82 interval. Cumulative Foreign Direct Investment corresponds to the sum of all five years in the interval.
