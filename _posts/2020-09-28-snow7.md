[DOWNLOAD DATA](../data/snow7.zip)

This dataset contains polygons that correspond to the Grand Experiment attribute data compiled by Coleman (2019). The data is only available for 28 subdistricts. The rest of the observations were excluded given that there was no attribute data. The resulting (now projected) map consists of the 28 adjacent subdistricts, as described below:
