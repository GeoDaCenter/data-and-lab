[DOWNLOAD DATA](../data/snow2.zip)

This dataset contains 250 points that correspond to buildings where cholera deaths were recorded near the Broad Street pump. These data were shared publicly by Wilson (2011). The variables include an ID for each building, its coordinates, and a death count. The following variables were added: an ID for the closest pump, as well as the distance to it and to the Broad Street pump (in meters), and, finally, a dummy variable that classifies observations in terms of whether the Broad Street pump was the closest pump to them.
