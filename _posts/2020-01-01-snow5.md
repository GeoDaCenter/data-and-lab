[DOWNLOAD DATA](../data/snow5.zip)

This dataset combines the [deaths_by_bldg]((https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/snow2/) and the [8 pumps](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/snow6/) data from [John Snow's 1855 Broad St map](http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/21/120/15-78-1DB-22-1855-01-SnowMCC2-map1-rev.pdf). The dataset contains 48 polygons which represent six rings that progress in 10-meter increments from each of the 8 pumps (see [deaths_by_8rings](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/snow5/)). Its variables include an ID for the rings and for the pumps, respectively, the coordinates of the pumps, the cholera death count per ring and the distance from each ring to the closest pump, the area of each ring, and the density of deaths in each ring.
