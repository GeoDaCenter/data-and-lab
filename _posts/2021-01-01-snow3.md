[DOWNLOAD DATA](../data/snow3.zip)

This dataset contains housing blocks, in the forms of polygons, which aggregate cholera deaths in the vicinity of the Broad Street pump. Originally, 39 observations were provided by Wilson (2011), with an ID for the polygons, a death count and the death density (in terms of population). An additional observation (ID=1) was created to account for a particular building where John Snow found that people did not drink water from the Broad Street pump, which is the workhouse selected.
